# My Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and a touch of **JavaScript**. 
It showcases my skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and responsive layout.
The portfolio is designed to provide a simple and professional online presence, suitable for job applications, freelance opportunities, or sharing work with others.


## 📖 Extended Description

The portfolio includes dedicated sections for an introduction, skills summary, recent projects, and contact information. 
It serves as both a resume and a visual representation of my work and design sensibility.

The project was built from scratch using semantic HTML and custom CSS, with mobile responsiveness in mind. 
JavaScript is used for minor interactivity (e.g., menu toggle, form validation, scroll animations). 
No frameworks or libraries were used, keeping the project lightweight and easy to maintain or extend.

This site can be easily updated as new projects are completed or skills are added.
